# Reporting Security Issues

## READ ME BEFORE GOING FURHTER
Even tho i have quite the years on my back regarding the world of Cyber Security, **I am not unfailing**. 
Plus, i built this in less then 12 days and the only users were me and my doctors, so i didn't need to be "extreme" or "compliant" with anything.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please, use the the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/pazDontExist/mental-space-app/security/advisories/new) tab.

Surprisingly is very well made.
